BoggleSolver
============

A Boggle Solver written in Java.

Configured to be packaged as a runnable jar. Requires a dictionary file as a text file with one word per line. No special characters allowed in the dictionary (only letters a-z, case-insensitive).

The output will be sorted first by length of word, then alphabetically.
